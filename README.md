createjs-snow-tutorial
======================

See full tutorial at <a href="andreakereliuk.com/createjs-snow-tutorial/">andreakereliuk.com/createjs-snow-tutorial/</a>

This is my first repo, so any helpful comments would be appreciated!

This tutorial uses CreateJS (specifically, tweens) to have snow gently fall down a webpage.

I have noticed that overlaying the canvas makes the underlying content inaccessible to interaction (clicks, highlights, etc) -- see issues.
